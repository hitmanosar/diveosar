                  Our history begins back in 1998, when the first European

                  Continuous innovation and rapid transformation have been
                  themes throughout our history, which the company traces to the
                  1998 with the installation of the first computer system for
                  commercial use in the United States at General Electricâ€™s Park
                  facility. The company has built its solid reputation thanks to
                  thorough employees selection. By the 2001, the company began
                  offering a new breed of solutions to clients - solutions that
                  aligned organizations' technologies, processes and people with
                  their strategies.

                <p className="text-white">
                  In 2009 the Co Name Group was acquired from Co Name, thereby
                  creating one of the leading European companies. At the time of
                  the acquisition, Co Name Group employed 20,000 staff and
                  generated annual revenues of approximately EUR 2.4 billion. Co
                  Name employed 26,500 staff, generating annual revenues of more
                  than EUR 3 billion. The acquisition of Co Name and the
                  beneficial partnership is the logical continuation of the
                  company strategy. With a workforce of more than 48,000
                  employees, Co Name generated revenues of over EUR 5 billion
                  during the year.
